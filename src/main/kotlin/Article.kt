/** the aim of this class is to practice the following:
 * 1. create class and its constructor(s)/functions
 * 2. implement nested function for readability purposes
 * 3. revise multiple learning outcomes:
 *      when keyword, kotlin libraries, dealing with lists, and manipulate data for certain purpose.
 * 4. Practice 'vararg': To pass a variable number of arguments to a function [instead of a,b,c,d..etc. One argument is enough]

// To inherit a superclass, write the name of superclass after the parentheses of subclass.
// Also, it is required to identify the superclass as an 'open class'.
// Example: class Article(a, b, c) : Website()
//          open class website()
// Abstract class: instead of writing 'open' before class, write 'abstract' keyword in order to make it an abstract.
//                 The purpose of abstract class is to initialize a function for all classes and each class has its own definition.
//                 Example: area() definition for rectangle is different from triangle.
// As for visibility modifiers (public,private..etc),
// check kotlin.org docs for clear demonstration: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/visibility-modifiers.html#class-members
