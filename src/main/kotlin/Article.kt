/** the aim of this class is to practice the following:
 * 1. create class and its constructor(s)/functions
 * 2. implement nested function for readability purposes
 * 3. revise multiple learning outcomes:
 *      when keyword, kotlin libraries, dealing with lists, and manipulate data for certain purpose.
 * 4. Practice 'vararg': To pass a variable number of arguments to a function [instead of a,b,c,d..etc. One argument is enough]
